# Practical Machine Learning
# Wearable Computing: Self-tracking and quality of the movement activities

Nowadays, it is possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity by using devices such as *Jawbone Up*, *Nike FuelBand*, and *Fitbit*. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement, as people like to quantify how much they do a particular activity (but they rarely quantify *how well they do it*).

The goal of this project is to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants, in order to quantify *how well participants do it*. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways (see [Refs.[1-2]](http://web.archive.org/web/20161224072740/http:/groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har) for more details), i.e., 10 repetitions in five different fashions: 

- *Class A* - exactly according to the specification;

- *Class B* - throwing the elbows to the front;

- *Class C* - lifting the dumbbell only halfway;

- *Class D* - lowering the dumbbell only halfway;

- *Class E* - throwing the hips to the front.

Class A corresponds to the specified execution of the exercise, while the other 4 classes correspond to common mistakes. Participants were supervised by an experienced weight lifter to make sure the execution complied to the manner they were supposed to simulate. The exercises were performed by six male participants aged between 20-28 years, with little weight lifting experience. We made sure that all participants could easily simulate the mistakes in a safe and controlled manner by using a relatively light dumbbell (1.25kg).

To predict the manner in which the participants did the exercise, a model is built and described step by step. Additionally, the machine learning algorithm will be applied to the 20 test cases (results of these tests represent a second part of the project which is not included in the current report).
